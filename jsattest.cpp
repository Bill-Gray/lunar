/*  NOTE that 'ssattest' now provides testing of Galilean satellite
ephems,  as well as Saturnian satellite ephems.  The following
program is not entirely obsolete,  but it's close to it.

   A little test program I wrote to test out my implementation of Lieske's E5
theory of the Galilean satellites,  as written in 'jsats.cpp'.  It works by
reading in an ASCII ephemeris of Jovicentric vectors for a given satellite,
computing the position for that satellite at that time using E5,  and showing
the difference,  both as an absolute XYZ in J2000 ecliptic coordinates and
in terms of "along-track" and "radial" components.  The latter allowed me to
see a long-term quadratic drift for Ganymede and Callisto.  (They were in
opposite directions,  so I'm confident that it's not a situation where I've
got the whole system rotating somehow.  My guess is that the mean longitudes
for those satellites should include a small quadratic term,  instead of
being just linear functions of time.)        */
