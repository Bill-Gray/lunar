# MPC optimistically states (see
# https://minorplanetcenter.net/media/newsletters/MPC_Newsletter_Oct2023.pdf
# ) that the extension allowing packed provisional designations past cycle 620
# = 15500th object in a half-month will not be used after the end of 2035,
# and that therefore the year will be designated by an uppercase letter.  I am
# less sanguine and am allowing lowercase letters (hence base-62) to allow the
# scheme to work to the end of 2061.  With any luck,  I'll be dead by then.
